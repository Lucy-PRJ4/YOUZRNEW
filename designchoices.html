	  <h4>Index Page</h4>
	  <p>We wanted our index page to stand out and be accessible. Creating a navigation bar made it very easy and seemless to travel around the website with a simple touch of a button. Our home page includes our values, vision, mission and about. The visitors will be able to access all the information in one combined page. Additionally, we added a carousel with images which represent our brand in order to give users more of a feeling of what our company is all about. The landing page is the first visual aspect new users will see, so we made sure to completely design it to fit our brand.</p>

	  <h4>Contacts</h4>
	  <p>We dedicated a page to our contacts so it's easy for customers to reach us. We believe communication is important so we want to give our clients the opportunity to provide us with feedback and feel like we can always help them. Contacting YOUZR! is very simple and accesible. We are reachable through Facebook and Instagram, as well as via email or through our YOUZR! hotline. </p>

	  <h4>Website Purpose</h4>
	  <p>We made our website simple including only the essential information. It is used as a presentation of our service as well as a guide to the rest of our social media and a way for our clients to communicate with us. This website will serve as the face of our brand, representing our vision, values and ideas.</p>

	  <h4>Our Audience</h4>
	  <p>The YOUZR! audience consists of people aged 26-50 years old, who are looking for a better future with a job they love. We are mostly focussed on Europe, the United Kingdom and the U.S.A.. The design is specifically made to be appealing to our entire target audience, with the use of purple and black colours. </p>

	  <h4>Colour Codes</h4>
	  <p>We chose the colours from our logo to represent our brand - purple and black, and combined them with white and grey so the colour palette will be contrasting and clear but still complimentary. The colour codes are: #050505 for the header and footer, #000000 for the black fonts, #777, #ccc, #aaa and #888 for the grey fonts and shades, then #FF00FF for the purple boxes. The website automatically fills the background colour in white. </p>

	  <h4>Fonts</h4>
	  <p>We wanted our title fonts to stand out while our body text is subtle but clear. For the quotes we chose an elegant cursive style which is commonly used for that purpose. We used: 'Bowlby One SC' cursive for our titles, 'Caveat' cursive for the quotes, 'Rubik', 'Roboto' Helvetica Arial sans-serif and 'Oswald' sans-serif for the main body texts. </p>

	  <h4>User Testing</h4>
	  <p>We sent our website via social media (Facebook, WhatsApp) and e-mail to 5 acquaintances from our target group. After navigating through it we sent asked them if they found it easy to use the website and if it provided them with sufficient information. Some of the questions we included were based on the purpose of our brand and the service that we offer, as well as if they felt like it would easy for them to reach us and receive an answer. At the end we asked them to rate the usability of the website on the scale from 1-10.</p>

	  <h4>Improvement Suggestions</h4>
	  <p>Overall the results we received were positive. The average rating was 7/10. Most people thought that the index page was clear in presenting our brand and the links to the rest of the information were simple to follow. However it seems to be long and full of quotes which some found distracting. Our future improvements would include creating a separate page for  motivating  clients and move the quotes and some extra information there. </p>
